# Car Project Hardware Overview

This repository details the hardware components used in our car project, highlighting the main parts and the challenges we face during development.

## Hardware Components

### 1. Raspberry Pi
The heart of our car project, the Raspberry Pi is a small, affordable computer that runs our software and manages communications between the various components.

**Challenge:** The current API for Picon Zero does not support Python 3. We are working on creating an updated API that will be compatible.

### 4. LIDAR LDS-01
The LIDAR LDS-01 is used for obstacle detection and mapping, providing accurate distance measurements in real-time.

**Challenge:** Currently, there is no Python API available for the LIDAR sensor. We plan to develop and share our own API soon.

We appreciate your interest in our project, and we will update this repository as we make progress on our APIs. Stay tuned!
