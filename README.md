# WRO Future Engineers Challenge 2024 - Qatar Speeder Team (QST)

Welcome to the official repository for the **Qatar Speeder Team (QST)**, also known as **Qspeeder Team**, competing in the **WRO Future Engineers Challenge 2024**! This repository includes all code, documentation, and resources related to our self-driving car project.

## Team Members
- **Supervisor**: Dr. Mohammed Salameh
- **Designer**: st1
- **Programmer**: st2

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, our autonomous self-driving vehicle competes in two tasks:

1. **Open Challenge**: The vehicle must complete **three laps** on a track with random placements of the inside track walls.
2. **Obstacle Challenge**: The vehicle must complete **three laps**, navigating based on randomly placed **green** and **red traffic signs**, and finish with **parallel parking**.

## Repository Structure
- **/src**: Source code for the car's autonomous driving logic.
- **/docs**: Documentation for game rules, strategies, and approach.
- **/simulations**: Simulations and testing environments.
- **/hardware**: Information on hardware and sensor setup.

## Setup and Installation
To set up the project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/momar82/QSTSS_WRO2024.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    # Replace with your dependencies if any
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run simulations or deploy code to the vehicle.

## Goals
- Develop a robust AI for autonomous navigation.
- Adapt to randomized track conditions.
- Ensure precise parallel parking.
