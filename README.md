# WRO Future Engineers Challenge 2025 - Qatar Speeder Team (QST)

Welcome to the official repository for **Qatar Speeder Team (QST)**, competing in the **WRO Future Engineers Challenge 2025**! This repository contains all the code, documentation, and resources for our autonomous self-driving car project.

## üöó Project Overview
In this challenge, our autonomous self-driving vehicle must navigate a dynamic track, adapting to obstacles, track changes, and other challenges. Our goal is to develop a high-performance, AI-powered vehicle capable of precise and efficient navigation.

## üë• Team Members
- **Supervisor:** Dr. Mohammed Salameh  
- **Designer:** TBD  
- **Programmer:** TBD  

## üîß Hardware Specifications
We are using the following hardware components:

### **Main Components**
- **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (8GB RAM)** *(to be upgraded to Raspberry Pi 5, 8GB/16GB)*
- **Micro SD Card 128GB**
- **PiRacer Pro** - AI Expansion Board ([Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/PiRacer_Pro_AI_Kit))
- **RPi Camera** *(to be upgraded to Raspberry Pi AI Camera)*
- **Car powered by 4x18650 batteries**
- **8.4V battery charger + EU head**
- **T-MINI-Plus Lidar Scanner 360¬∞ TOF Ranging 12M 3D Sensor Kit** ([AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006911780813.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.1ce11802nsbtib))

## üñ•Ô∏è Software & Frameworks
We plan to experiment with the following software frameworks for development and testing:

### **Planned Software Stack**
- **Donkey Car API** for autonomous driving
- **ROS 2** (Robot Operating System) for real-time robotics control
