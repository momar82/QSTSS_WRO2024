## Repository Structure
- **/src**: Source code for the car's autonomous driving logic.
- **/docs**: Documentation for game rules, strategies, and approach.
- **/simulations**: Simulations and testing environments.
- **/hardware**: Information on hardware and sensor setup.

## Setup and Installation
To set up the project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qst-wro2024.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    # Replace with your dependencies if any
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run simulations or deploy code to the vehicle.

## Goals
- Develop a robust AI for autonomous navigation.
- Adapt to randomized track conditions.
- Ensure precise parallel parking.
